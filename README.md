#**Exploring the New York Housing Market**

As a resident of New York State, I have noticed that there have been changes to the New York Housing Market good or bad but the one consistent thing has been the high prices across the tri-state area. This analysis aims to explore the New York housing market to uncover the factors that influence property prices. Our goal is to analyze how variables such as location, brokerage, property size, and other characteristics impact housing prices. We also investigate properties selling above the average price in specific zip codes to identify trends and outliers in the dataset.
